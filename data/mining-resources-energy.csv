Geoscientist (Geophysicist & Geologist)/นักธรณีวิทยาปิโตรเลียม,Pan Orient Energy (Siam) Ltd.,"Chatuchak, Bangkok",Mining - Exploration & Geoscience,Full time,,,"General Expectation Reporting directly to General Manager. Performs integrated geoscience study & assessment for POES’ fields to evaluate and capture all the opportunity on the existing L53 concessionaire Support business development (BD) evaluation especially surrounding existing acreage/concessionaire based on existing Seismic data. Important skillsets for Geologists include subsurface structural mapping, petrophysics, stratigraphic correlation, sand-mapping, reservoir quality assessment, reserves estimation, development planning, pore pressure and drilling/logging operations Important skillsets for Geophysicists include subsurface mapping from seismic volumes, hydrocarbon estimation, well planning, velocity modeling and complete understanding of complex fault networks in the Thailand basin. Other important skillsets include integration of rock physics/petrophysics with seismic attributes Familiar and power user with G&G software e.g. Petrel, Geolog, GS-Software, Log-Edit and Seisware etc. Role and Responsibilities: Interprets seismic and conducts seismic attribute analysis with 2013 and 2008 vintage 3D seismic surveys over the L53 Concession area. Updates time and depth structural maps, depositional facies interpretation and identify appraisal and infill opportunity across the entire L53 Concession area. Revise/update the well correlation for all wells in L53 Concession to tie with seismic horizon interpretation and integrates with engineering data (i.e., formation pressure and production data). Performs reservoir connectivity analysis to identify infill opportunities in potential undrilled compartment and supports reservoir management plan. Generate and matures development and infill drilling programs. Provide technical input and support to the generation of strategic and business plans including asset development plans. Provide support for developing Reserves/Resource estimates. Evaluate each well in terms of pay/non-pay reservoirs by using electric logs and any kind of data related to the wells e.g. pressure data, fluid samples and production data Perform well to well correlation in order to define reservoir names and their fluid connectivity in an accumulation. Integrates seismic, geological and production data to design the proven and/or probable and/or possible cases of net sand and net pay maps Provides QC and seismic interpretation support for seismic reprocessing Provides geoscience supports for production enhancement activities Evaluating offset data before the start of drilling. Liaise with Drilling superintendent, well engineers, drilling engineers, Operations manager and mudloggers during the course of drilling projects. Monitors and provides geoscience support for drilling operations Analyzing, evaluating and describing formations while drilling, using cuttings, gas, formation evaluation measurement while drilling and wireline data; Comparing data gathered during drilling with predictions made at the exploration stage; Advising on drilling hazards. Advising for making decisions about suspending or continuing drilling; Advising operations personnel on-site. Supervising mudlogging, and wireline services personnel and monitoring quality control in relation to these services; Keeping detailed records, writing reports, completing daily, weekly and post-well reporting logs and sending these to appropriate departments; Maintaining up-to-date knowledge of MWD (measuring while drilling) tools, such as gamma and resistivity, as geosteering becomes increasingly important; Communicating regularly with BKK operations offices. Quick process wireline evaluation log. Quick process petro physic log. Deliverables: Seismic interpretation, subsurface mapping from seismic volumes, hydrocarbon estimation Petrophysics, stratigraphic correlation, sand-mapping, reservoir quality assessment, reserves estimation Assist in technical discussions with partners and DMF. Ensure partners and DMF technical requirements are met. Assist in technical discussions with 3rd party company reserve evaluation. Offset well correlation in order to define reservoir names and peroperty. Daily geology report and afternoon update. Wireline log evaluation. Petro physic log evaluation. Cutting sample storage and submit to DMF as per regulation. Provide Geological comment in End of well report. Specific Geological report as require."
