The School has now grown to over 1,100 students and attracts students from all over Thailand and South East Asia. The structure, School day and ethos of RST are based upon the British Independent School model, rather than the standard international school model. As such, the School has three sections: Pre-Prep (2-6 year olds), Prep (7 – 12 year olds) and Senior (13 – 18 year olds). Rugby School Thailand is the first overseas sister school of Rugby School UK, one of the most prestigious and well-known schools in the UK.

In the Sixth Form, Rugby School Thailand students study A Levels. There are currently around 300 in the Senior section of the School.

The Senior buildings are designed to offer an outstanding learning environment. The main buildings include a teaching block; state-of-the-art Design and Technology and Art and Design studios; ICT suites; Drama studios; a Black Box theatre; Music classrooms; seventeen music practice rooms; a recording studio; and a dance studio. A separate Science Centre houses 13 laboratories, and a lecture theatre. The Webb Ellis Centre houses both 50m and 25m swimming pools plus a warm up pool; an air-conditioned basketball stadium; a fitness suite; gymnasium; and two PE classrooms. Floodlit football fields and tennis courts complete the sports facilities. The Sixth Form Centre provides a hub for Year 12 and 13 students as they pursue independent and group study as they complete their A Levels.

Psychology has grown in popularity with there being two classes now in both Year 12 and Year 13.

In 2019, she went through big changes in her life and learned much about life in a way that she had not encountered before. She wished that from a young age she had an opportunity to learn life strategies and to be better equipped to tackle whatever challenges life brings. Her realisation that “PERFECTION DOES NOT GUARANTEE HAPPINESS. WE, OURSELVES, CAN CREATE HAPPINESS AND LIVE LIFE THE WAY WE THINK WE DESERVE” led her to understand that the best time to plant thinking processes and strategies into one’s life is from 0-6 years old, the time when we absorb everything and form humanity in our hearts. Therefore, she started her kindergarten project in 2021 with a strong passion to create: ”a generation that is humane, happy, responsible, and capable, who will one day become high quality citizens of the world, who will not be not harmful to themselves or others, know their rights and get to lead the life they deserve.” Lovell International School is designed and built with the aim to enhance the most crucial skill of the alpha generation, EF (Executive Function). The skill that will help them overcome difficulties/boredom/challenges in order to achieve their goals. All the school facilities including the 12 classrooms are designed to enhance brain development and motor skills such as swimming pool, splash pool, gym, dance studio, cooking class, art studio, musical wall, in/outdoor playgrounds, and a family library for parents and children to build a lifelong learning community together. The harmony of the learning environment comes from a blend of established big trees and other natural elements such as a bug hotel, keyhole, flower garden with butterfly farm, the green kitchen, and many varieties of edible plants and vegetables for the children to explore. The school curriculum uses the British Early Years Foundation stage (EYFS) and National Curriculum blended with the philosophy of Reggio Emilia.",Education & Training
